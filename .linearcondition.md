WIP: Contact me if you need.

Linear Condition is a good bad idea. 
The idea was to allow to quickly request action based on the following of some condition.
In theory it is a good idea.
In practice, it conflict often with the rest. For example

```
// I tried to say if you press left then up then right
LeftArrow ➤ UpArrow  ➤ RightArrow ♦ debuglog Test ♦ GlobalExitTime 2000 ☗BreakTime 100 ☗StepExitTime 1000 ☗TriggerOnFound ☗TriggerOnExit

//The problems
// - If the user press them all, it true true.
// - You need to precise some break time to reset it when possible
// - ...

// A solution is to be precise but it make it so long and so boring to deal with.
// And that only for simple Left  ➤ Up  ➤ Down
LeftArrow + !UpArrow + !RightArrow  ➤    !LeftArrow + UpArrow + !RightArrow ➤  !LeftArrow + !UpArrow + RightArrow ♦ debuglog Test ♦ GlobalExitTime 2000 ☗BreakTime 100 ☗StepExitTime 20000 ☗TriggerOnFound ☗TriggerOnExit
```

So if you need to be complicated, rather be precisely complicated ^^.
