Hi !

You want to use Open Macro Input. Let's start.
In this tutorial, we will just download and launch it to see how it works. 

If you want to understand a bit better how it work after that, I invite you to do the following tutorial:
- ðŸš§ [Hello World OMI](#) : Write "Hello world" when touching key of the keyboard depending of the application.
- ðŸš§ [League of Legend: Sona](#) : Play the champion Sona in League of legend with Midi Piano or Xbox controller.
- ðŸš§ [Window Paint with screen zone](#) : Use screen zone to use a software that is not design with shortcut.  
- ðŸš§ [Krita Basic Short cut on Xbox](#) : Use Xbox controller as custom tool to paint.

## How to set up

4. Exit (because of a bug not fixed yet)
