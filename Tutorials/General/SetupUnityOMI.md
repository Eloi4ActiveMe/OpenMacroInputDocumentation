Hi !

Thanks you for taking the time to understand my tool.

I will try to make it easy...
But: 
- It is a prototype
- I am solo developer
- Macro software are never easy-easy.

But if you are not here accidently and you take the time to learn how to use the tool OMI,
I can guaranty that it is going to be useful in your life.


## How to set up
1. Download
2. Launch OMI
3. Set JOMI IP and auto launch.
4. Exit (because of a bug not fixed yet)
5. Launch JOMI & OMI 
6. Delete the content of 'Configuration' 
7. Copy the 'configuration' from a source you want:
  - Friend, Website
  - Tutorial and example
  - Community Store(s) 
  - ...
